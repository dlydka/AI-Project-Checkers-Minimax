# Checkers-AI - Project for AI University classes. 

## Aim
 
 The main goal was to create a simple Checkers game with feature of playing against AI using minimax algorithm for making best decisicions in each turn. Then were made some experiments with two AI players playing against each other with different Heuristic functions.

 More information about this project and experiments results are in Sprawozdanie_SI.pdf (but only in Polish)
